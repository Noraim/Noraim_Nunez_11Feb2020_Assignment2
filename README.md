# LHC Assignment 2: Version Control, Loops, Good Code 

Question 1. Pretend you have the following sequence of numbers given. 
a) Sum: Add up all of the numbers in a continous loop such that newly declared vectors will be automatically added.
b) Average: This is the sum divided by the total number of numbers in the list (i.e. the vector), N. To get the size of a vector, try looking into the size() method for vectors.
C) Standard Deviation: A measure of the average spread of the values in a list. 

Question 2. Apply Project Euler from assignemnt #1 into a clear code with loops. 

Question 3. Write a code that creates a vector of floats and fills it within a
loop. During each iteration of the loop, the user will have to enter commands via the std::cin call that direct the loop to either terminate, and break out of the loop, or proceed to adding another entry onto the vector. If the command is to fill another entry, then the entry should be a random number that is evenly distributed between 0 and 1. Print out the entire contents of the vector including its location in memory. Describe how exactly c++ is allocating memory when you create and expand the vector you have created.

Question 4: Bonus. From Project Euler, describe the procedure or algorithm that you would use to solve question 4. Now implement this in code using the same requirements for how you write the code as you did for Question 1 above.
